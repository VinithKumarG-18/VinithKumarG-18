# Voice Assistant Error Fixes

This document outlines the critical issues identified in the voice assistant application and the fixes implemented.

## Identified Issues

### 1. WebSocket JSON Parsing Error
**Error**: `Extra data: line 1 column 2 (char 1)`
**Cause**: The WebSocket was receiving multiple JSON objects in a single message, causing JSON parsing to fail.
**Fix**: Implemented robust JSON parsing that handles multiple JSON objects in a single message using `json.JSONDecoder.raw_decode()`.

### 2. None/Null Data Handling in Audio Processing Threads
**Errors**: 
- `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'shape'`
- `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'astype'`
- `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'NoneType' and 'int'`

**Cause**: Threads were receiving None values from queues during shutdown but weren't handling them properly.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive null checking and validation in all audio processing modules:
- `noise_cancellation.py`: Validates frame type and size before processing
- `voice_activity_detection.py`: Checks chunk validity before conversion
- `voice_cancellation.py`: Validates voice chunks before RMS calculation
- `speech_to_text.py`: Ensures voice segments are valid before transcription

### 3. Google TTS 400 Bad Request Error
**Error**: `400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/text:synthesize`
**Cause**: Empty or invalid text being sent to Google TTS API.
**Fix**: 
- Added text validation and cleaning in `TextToSpeech.synthesize_speech()`
- Implemented proper error handling for different HTTP status codes
- Added text length limits and sanitization

### 4. Thread Synchronization and Graceful Shutdown
**Issue**: Threads weren't shutting down properly, causing resource leaks and errors.
**Fix**: 
- Added `shutdown_flag` to coordinate thread shutdown
- Implemented proper queue termination with None signals
- Added thread join with timeout for graceful shutdown
- Used `put_nowait()` to prevent blocking on full queues

### 5. Call SID Handling
**Issue**: Call SID was None, causing tracking issues.
**Fix**: Added fallback call_sid generation using timestamp when not provided.

## Key Improvements

### Error Handling
- All modules now have comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Graceful degradation when external dependencies fail (RNNoise DLL, Whisper model, etc.)
- Proper logging of errors without crashing the application

### Queue Management
- Non-blocking queue operations to prevent deadlocks
- Proper queue size management to prevent memory issues
- Timeout-based queue operations for responsive shutdown

### Resource Management
- Proper cleanup of RNNoise resources
- Thread lifecycle management
- Memory-efficient audio buffer handling

### Robustness
- Fallback mechanisms when AI models aren't available
- Input validation at every processing stage
- Resilient WebSocket message handling

## Configuration Requirements

1. **Google TTS API Key**: Ensure your API key is valid and has TTS permissions
2. **RNNoise DLL**: Verify the DLL path exists (Windows-specific)
3. **ngrok URL**: Update the WebSocket URL to match your ngrok tunnel

## Dependencies

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing

The fixes ensure:
1. No more AttributeError exceptions from None values
2. Graceful handling of WebSocket connection issues
3. Proper TTS error handling with informative messages
4. Clean thread shutdown without resource leaks
5. Robust audio processing pipeline that continues working even if individual components fail

## Notes

- The application now degrades gracefully when dependencies are missing
- All critical sections have error handling
- Memory usage is controlled through buffer size limits
- Thread safety is improved with proper synchronization
